**Getting Started**

To set up Automaton Community locally, you'll need Python and Django installed. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prerequisites**
    * Python (version X.Y or later recommended) - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Django (install using `pip install django`) - [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/br0nke/automaton.git
   ```

3. **Set up Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   (Refer to Django documentation for specific commands based on your operating system.)

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser Account**

   Replace `admin` and `your_strong_password` with your desired credentials:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser admin your_strong_password
   ```

7. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You should now be able to access Automaton Community in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/
